# calculator
A basic browser calculator that allows for addition, subtraction. multiplication, division, and follows bedmas order of operations for these operators.

The styling on this project is very basic, as I was focused on the logic behind this project more than the visual. I do plan on updating the css to recreate the "chocolate calculator" from scholastic book fair.
